##  NL2SQL Analytics Studio

 This is a prototype used to show companies how to build their own local analytics studios. A deployed-style analytics application that lets users upload their own datasets, ask questions in natural language, generate read-only SQL, run queries safely, create plots, and maintain a reproducible analysis history with monitoring. Uses DuckDB and SGLlite as well as a chat feature built on langchain with agent calls to connect to SQL or to a RAG style information retrieval when necessary. Demonstrates model deployment and monitoring capability.

##  Agentic AI Evaluation Pipeline
Developed LLM-based evaluation and orchestration framework for automated underwriting decision support for the Casualty Actuarial Society. Using LangChain, Python, AWS Lambda, OpenAI, NLP to demonstrate the power of AI Agents in automated workflows. Trying to educate the masses on the difference between automation, vanilla LLMs, and LLMs within automation for extra powerful workflows.

##  Healthcare & Mortality Forecasting

### Risk Factor Forecasting
Built deep learning and Bayesian models to forecast health events such as cardiovascular health failure and epileptic events using longitudinal clinical data.  Developed a novel framework built into a neural network to understand factors that drive the forecasting, including the significance of historical changes in brain function and health measurements.

### Regional Forecasting for Mortality and Mental Health
Built hierarchical Bayesian models to understand the impact of regional variations on health and mortality trends. Discovered regions where socio-economic and demographic characteristics affect mortality and suicide in different ways.
